## 1) Logistic Regression
* It is implemented from scratch.
 
### What is Logistic Regression?
* Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis.
Regression analysis is a type of predictive modeling technique which is 
used to find the relationship between a dependent variable (usually known as the “Y” variable) 
and either one independent variable (the “X” variable) or a series of independent variables. 
When two or more independent variables are used to predict or explain the outcome of the dependent variable
this is known as multiple regression.

## 2) Custom Training using Tensorflow
* Slightly different dataset classified using tensorflow and keras capabilities.
* "You all know the standard model — one input, one output, one loss function, and also maybe couple of different metrics. 
You can define the model with Seq API or Func API, compile it and train it, then maybe evaluate.
Sometimes, there are not always single inputs. neither single output. This is why you would need custom models. This repo is showing a basic model,
to see the logic behind it."
